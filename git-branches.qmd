## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Add some text.

```{r}

cool_cole <- c(1,2,3)

```

Sup


New_code

a <- c(seq(1:5))


### I am adding this to branch_2

```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# added a vector
```


```{r}

# Adding another vector, b

b <- c(1, 5, 10)


```
